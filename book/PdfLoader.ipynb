Odysseus also plays a key role in\\nHomer\\'s Iliad and other works in that same epic cycle.\\nAs the son of Laërtes and Anticlea, husband of\\nPenelope, and father of Telemachus, Acusilaus, and\\nTelegonus,[2] Odysseus is renowned for his intellectual\\nbrilliance, guile, and versatility (polytropos), and he is\\nthus known by the epithet Odysseus the Cunning\\n(Ancient Greek: μ ῆ τις, romanized: mêtis, lit. \\'cunning\\nintelligence\\'[3]). He is most famous for his nostos, or\\n\"homecoming\", which took him ten eventful years\\nafter the decade-long Trojan War.[4]\\nThe form Ὀ δυσ(σ)εύς Odys(s)eus is used starting in\\nthe epic period and through the classical period, but\\nvarious other forms are also found. In vase\\ninscriptions, there are the variants Oliseus (Ὀ λισεύς),\\nOlyseus (Ὀ λυσεύς), Olysseus (Ὀ λυσσεύς), Olyteus\\n(Ὀ λυτεύς), Olytteus (Ὀ λυττεύς) and Ōlysseus\\n(Ὠ λυσσεύς).

Some have supposed that \"there may\\noriginally have been two separate figures, one called something like Odysseus, the other something like\\nUlixes, who were combined into one complex personality.\"[6] However, the change between d and l is\\ncommon also in some Indo-European and Greek names,[7] and the Latin form is supposed to be derived\\nfrom the Etruscan Uthuze (see below), which perhaps accounts for some of the phonetic innovations.\\nName, etymology, and epithets'),\n",

Ancient authors linked the name to the Greek verbs odussomai\\n(ὀ δύσσομαι) \"to be wroth against, to hate\",[8] to oduromai (ὀ δύρομαι) \"to lament, bewail\",[9][10] or even\\nto ollumi (ὄ λλυμι) \"to perish, to be lost\".[11][12] Homer relates it to various forms of this verb in\\nreferences and puns. In Book 19 of the Odyssey, where Odysseus\\'s early childhood is recounted, Euryclea\\nasks the boy\\'s grandfather Autolycus to name him. Euryclea seems to suggest a name like Polyaretos, \"for\\nhe has much been prayed for\" (πολυάρητος) but Autolycus \"apparently in a sardonic mood\" decided to\\ngive the child another name commemorative of \"his own experience in life\":[13] \"Since I have been\\nangered (ὀ δυσσάμενος odyssamenos) with many, both men and women, let the name of the child be\\nOdysseus\".[14] Odysseus often receives the patronymic epithet Laertiades (Λαερτιάδης), \"son of Laërtes\".\\nIt has also been suggested that the name is of non-Greek origin, possibly not even Indo-European, with an\\nunknown etymology.[15] Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin.[16] In Etruscan religion,\\nthe name (and stories) of Odysseus were adopted under the name Uthuze (Uθuze), which has been\\ninterpreted as a parallel borrowing from a preceding Minoan form of the name (possibly *Oduze,\\npronounced [ ˈ o t͡ θu t͡ se]); this theory is also supposed to explain the insecurity of the phonologies (d or l),\\nsince the affricate [t͡ θ], unknown to the Greek of that time, gave rise to different counterparts (i. e. δ or λ\\nin Greek, θ in Etruscan).[17]\\nIn the Iliad and Odyssey, Homer uses several epithets to describe Odysseus, starting with the opening,\\nwhere he is described as \"the man of many devices\" (in the 1919 Murray translation). The Greek word\\nused is polytropos, literally the man of many turns, and other translators have suggested alternate English\\ntranslations, including \"man of twists and turns\" (Fagles 1996) and \"a complicated man\" (Wilson 2018).\\nIn the account of Dares the Phrygian, Odysseus was illustrated as \"tough, crafty, cheerful, of medium\\nheight, eloquent, and wise.\"[18] In Book III of Homer\\'s Iliad Priam describes him as \"shorter in truth by a\\nhead than Atreus\\' son Agamemnon, / but broader, it would seem, in the chest and across the shoulders /... /\\nTruly, to some deep-fleeced ram would I liken him / who makes his way through the great mass of the\\nshining sheep-flocks.\"[19] and in the same book Antenor recalls that \"Menelaus with his broad shoulders\\nwas the taller, but Odysseus was the more imposing of the two when they were both seated.\"[20] In Book\\nVI of Homer\\'s Odyssey, he is described as having \"bushy locks\" that \"hang from his head thick as the\\npetals of a hyacinth in bloom\".[21] In Book XVI of Homer\\'s Odyssey he is said to have a \"bronze tan\"[22]\\nand in Book XVIII of Homer\\'s Odyssey, it is said that Odysseus \"bared his fine massive thighs. His broad\\nshoulders, his chest and brawny arms were now revealed\".[23]\\nRelatively little is given of Odysseus\\'s fictional background other than that according to Pseudo-\\nApollodorus, his paternal grandfather or step-grandfather is Arcesius, son of Cephalus and grandson of\\nAeolus, while his maternal grandfather is the thief Autolycus, son of Hermes[24] and Chione; this\\ngenealogy places Odysseus as the great-grandson of the Olympian god Hermes. In the Odyssey, however,\\nwhile Hermes passes on his skill of thievery to Autolycus, there is no indication of a genealogical\\nconnection between the two.[25][26]\\nDescription\\nGenealogy'),\n",

Two stories in particular are well\\nknown:\\nWhen Helen of Troy is abducted, Menelaus calls upon the other suitors to honour their oaths and help\\nhim to retrieve her, an attempt that leads to the Trojan War. Odysseus tries to avoid it by feigning lunacy,\\nas an oracle had prophesied a long-delayed return home for him if he went. He hooks a donkey and an ox\\nto his plow (as they have different stride lengths, hindering the efficiency of the plow) and (some modern\\nsources add) starts sowing his fields with salt. Palamedes, at the behest of Menelaus\\'s brother\\nAgamemnon, seeks to disprove Odysseus\\'s madness and places Telemachus, Odysseus\\'s infant son, in\\nfront of the plow. Odysseus veers the plow away from his son, thus exposing his stratagem.[35] Odysseus\\nholds a grudge against Palamedes during the war for dragging him away from his home.\\nOdysseus and other envoys of Agamemnon travel to Scyros to recruit Achilles because of a prophecy that\\nTroy could not be taken without him. By most accounts, Thetis, Achilles\\'s mother, disguises him as a\\nwoman to hide him from the recruiters because an oracle had predicted that Achilles would either live a\\nlong uneventful life or achieve everlasting glory while dying young. Odysseus cleverly discovers which\\namong the women before him is Achilles, when Achilles is the only one of them to show interest in\\nexamining the weapons hidden among an array of adornment gifts for the daughters of their host.\\nOdysseus arranges further for the sounding of a battle horn, which prompts Achilles to clutch a weapon\\nand show his trained disposition. With his disguise foiled, he is exposed and joins Agamemnon\\'s call to\\narms among the Hellenes.[36]\\nOdysseus is represented as one of the most influential Greek champions during the Trojan War in\\nHomer\\'s account. Along with Nestor and Idomeneus he is one of the most trusted counsellors and\\nadvisors. He always champions the Achaean cause, especially when others question Agamemnon\\'s\\ncommand, as in one instance when Thersites speaks against him.

Eventually (and reluctantly), he\\nconsents.[41] During the funeral games for Patroclus,\\nOdysseus becomes involved in a wrestling match with Ajax\\n\"The Greater\" and foot race with Ajax \"The Lesser\", son of Oileus and Nestor\\'s son Antilochus. He draws\\nthe wrestling match, and with the help of the goddess Athena, he wins the race.[42]\\nOdysseus has traditionally been viewed as Achilles\\'s antithesis in the Iliad:[43] while Achilles\\'s anger is\\nall-consuming and of a self-destructive nature, Odysseus is frequently viewed as a man of the mean, a\\nvoice of reason, renowned for his self-restraint and diplomatic skills. He is also in some respects\\nantithetical to Telamonian Ajax (Shakespeare\\'s \"beef-witted\" Ajax): while the latter has only brawn to\\nrecommend him, Odysseus is not only ingenious (as evidenced by his idea for the Trojan Horse), but an\\neloquent speaker, a skill perhaps best demonstrated in the embassy to Achilles in book 9 of the Iliad. The\\ntwo are not only foils in the abstract but often opposed in practice since they have many duels and run-\\nins.\\nSince a prophecy suggested that the Trojan War would not be won without Achilles, Odysseus and several\\nother Achaean leaders are described in the Achilleid as having gone to Skyros to find him. Odysseus\\ndiscovered Achilles by offering gifts, adornments and musical instruments as well as weapons, to the\\nking\\'s daughters, and then having his companions imitate the noises of an enemy\\'s attack on the island\\n(most notably, making a blast of a trumpet heard), which prompted Achilles to reveal himself by picking\\na weapon to fight back, and together they departed for the Trojan War.[45]\\nOther stories from the Trojan War'),\n",

One tradition says Odysseus convinces a Trojan\\ncaptive to write a letter pretending to be from Palamedes. A\\nsum of gold is mentioned to have been sent as a reward for\\nPalamedes\\'s treachery. Odysseus then kills the prisoner and\\nhides the gold in Palamedes\\'s tent. He ensures that the letter is\\nfound and acquired by Agamemnon, and also gives hints\\ndirecting the Argives to the gold. This is evidence enough for\\nthe Greeks, and they have Palamedes stoned to death. Other\\nsources say that Odysseus and Diomedes goad Palamedes\\ninto descending a well with the prospect of treasure being at\\nthe bottom. When Palamedes reaches the bottom, the two\\nproceed to bury him with stones, killing him.[46]\\nWhen Achilles is slain in battle by Paris, it is Odysseus and\\nAjax who retrieve the fallen warrior\\'s body and armour in the\\nthick of heavy fighting. During the funeral games for\\nAchilles, Odysseus competes once again with Ajax. Thetis\\nsays that the arms of Achilles will go to the bravest of the\\nGreeks, but only these two warriors dare lay claim to that\\ntitle. The two Argives became embroiled in a heavy dispute\\nabout one another\\'s merits to receive the reward. The Greeks\\ndither out of fear in deciding a winner, because they did not\\nwant to insult one and have him abandon the war effort. Nestor suggests that they allow the captive\\nTrojans to decide the winner.[47] The accounts of the Odyssey disagree, suggesting that the Greeks\\nthemselves hold a secret vote.[48] In any case, Odysseus is the winner. Enraged and humiliated, Ajax is\\ndriven mad by Athena. When he returns to his senses, in shame at how he has slaughtered livestock in his\\nmadness, Ajax kills himself by the sword that Hector had given him after their duel.[49]\\nTogether with Diomedes, Odysseus fetches Achilles\\'s son, Pyrrhus, to come to the aid of the Achaeans,\\nbecause an oracle had stated that Troy could not be taken without him. A great warrior, Pyrrhus is also\\ncalled Neoptolemus (Greek for \"new warrior\").

Upon their arrival, Philoctetes (still suffering from the wound) is\\nseen still to be enraged at the Danaans, especially at Odysseus, for abandoning him. Although his first\\ninstinct is to shoot Odysseus, his anger is eventually defused by Odysseus\\'s persuasive powers and the\\ninfluence of the gods.

Odysseus\\'s attempts to avoid his sacred oath to\\ndefend Menelaus and Helen offended Roman notions of duty,\\nand the many stratagems and tricks that he employed to get\\nhis way offended Roman notions of honour.\\nOdysseus is probably best known as the eponymous hero of the Odyssey. This epic describes his travels,\\nwhich lasted for 10 years, as he tries to return home after the Trojan War and reassert his place as rightful\\nking of Ithaca.\\nHomebound from Troy, after a raid on Ismarus in the land of\\nthe Cicones, he and his twelve ships are driven off course by\\nstorms. They visit the lethargic Lotus-Eaters and are captured\\nby the Cyclops Polyphemus while visiting his island. After\\nPolyphemus eats several of his men, he and Odysseus have a\\ndiscussion and Odysseus tells Polyphemus his name is Outis\\n(\"Nobody\"). Odysseus takes a barrel of wine and the Cyclops\\ndrinks it, falling asleep. Odysseus and his men take a wooden\\nstake, ignite it with the remaining wine, and blind him.

When Callidice died, Odysseus returned\\nhome to Ithaca, leaving their son, Polypoetes, to rule Thesprotia.[61] Contradicting the reading of\\nTiresias's prophecy in The Odyssey that Odysseus will have a gentle death in old age after making it\\nhome,[57][62] the Telogony claims that he met his death at the hands of Telegonus, his son with Circe, after\\na misunderstanding. Telegonus attacked his father with a poisoned, stingray spine-tipped spear, given to\\nhim by Circe. Before dying, Odysseus recognized his son.

Many cities did he\\nvisit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs\\nhe was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying\\nto save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he\\nmight he could not save his men, for they perished through their\\nown sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the\\ngod prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about\\nall these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you\\nmay know them.\\nSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got\\nsafely home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return\\nto his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who\\nhad got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years\\nwent by, there came a time when the gods settled that he should go\\nback to Ithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own\\npeople, his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had\\nnow begun to pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him\\nwithout ceasing and would not let him get home.\\nNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world\\'s\\nend, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East.\\nHe had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was\\nenjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of\\nOlympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that mo-\\nment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by\\nAgamemnon\\'s son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:\\n\"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all noth-\\ning but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love\\nto Agamemnon\\'s wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon,\\nthough he knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to\\nwarn him not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would\\nbe sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return'),\n",

Furthermore, wicked people are now try-\\ning to murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming home from\\nPylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get news\\nof his father.\"\\n\"What, my dear, are you talking about?\" replied her father, \"did you\\nnot send him there yourself, because you thought it would help\\nUlysses to get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are per-\\nfectly able to protect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again,\\nwhile the suitors have to come hurry-skurrying back without having\\nkilled him.\"\\nWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, \"Mercury, you\\nare our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that\\npoor Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods\\nnor men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is\\nto reach fertile Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin\\nto the gods, and will honour him as though he were one of ourselves.\\nThey will send him in a ship to his own country, and will give him\\nmore bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought back\\nfrom Troy, if he had had had all his prize money and had got home'),\n",

But\\nUlysses stuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of\\nthe Phaecians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated\\nhim as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and\\nwishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would\\nhave been here long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to\\nland gathering wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he\\nis; there is no one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the\\nThesprotians told me all this, and he swore to me- making drink-\\nofferings in his house as he did so- that the ship was by the water side\\nand the crew found who would take Ulysses to his own country. He\\nsent me off first, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing'),\n",

He lifted up his hands to heaven,\\nand prayed, saying \"Father Jove, since you have seen fit to bring me\\nover land and sea to my own home after all the afflictions you have\\nlaid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of\\nthose who are now waking within the house, and let me have another\\nsign of some kind from outside.\"\\nThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high\\nup among the from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad\\nwhen he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman\\nfrom hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him an-\\nother sign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to\\ngrind wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had\\nground their task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not\\nyet finished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she\\nheard the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her\\nmaster. \"Father Jove,\" said she, \"you who rule over heaven and earth,\\nyou have thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it,\\nand this means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of\\nme your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very last\\nday that the suitors dine in the house of Ulysses.
